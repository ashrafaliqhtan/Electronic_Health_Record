# Electronic Health Record (HER) Management System for Hospitals

## Overview

This project is an Electronic Health Record (EHR) Management System for hospitals developed using **PHP**, **HTML**, and **MySQL**. It focuses on providing a digital solution to manage hospital workflows and patient data efficiently. The system consists of specialized modules for Reception, Billing, Pharmacy, and Patient Interaction, enabling seamless data access, secure storage, and real-time communication between departments.

## Introduction

As technology transforms healthcare, the demand for paper-based records has significantly decreased. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) system plays a critical role in transforming medical practices and improving patient care. This system provides efficient management of patient records, billing information, and pharmaceutical inventory, contributing to higher quality care and enhanced operational performance.

### Objectives:
- Improve hospital workflows by digitizing records and processes.
- Automate routine tasks to reduce human error and time consumption.
- Enable real-time access to patient data for better healthcare management.
- Ensure secure storage and privacy of sensitive patient information.

## Methodology

The development of this EHR system followed a structured methodology to ensure a secure and organized approach.

### 1. Requirements Gathering and Analysis:
   - Identified the needs of healthcare providers, administrative staff, and patients.
   - Conducted interviews and surveys to gather functional and non-functional requirements.

### 2. System Design and Architecture:
   - Defined system components and modules such as Reception, Billing, Pharmacy, and Patient Interaction.
   - Created a high-level design to integrate the modules seamlessly.

### 3. Technology Selection:
   - **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
   - **Backend**: PHP and MySQL for data management.

### 4. Web Application Development:
   - Built and tested the system features such as appointment scheduling, billing, prescription management, etc.
   - Deployed the application locally for internal testing.

### 5. Maintenance and Support:
   - Ongoing monitoring, issue resolution, and updates to improve system performance.

## System Requirements

### 1. User Requirements:
- Receptionists can check in patients and schedule appointments.
- Staff can generate invoices and process payments.
- Pharmacists manage prescriptions and inventory.
- Patients can view their records, appointments, and billing details.

### 2. System Requirements:
- Centralized data storage on a secure server.
- High-performance data servers with 24/7 availability.
- Reliable internet connection for data security.

### 3. Functional Requirements:
- Patient check-in, appointment management, and notifications.
- Invoice generation, payment processing, and insurance claim handling.
- Prescription management and inventory tracking.
- Patient interaction module for record access and communication.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements:
- **Performance**: Ability to handle multiple users with minimal delays.
- **Scalability**: System must scale with increasing data.
- **Reliability**: Data backup and recovery solutions.
- **Security**: Data encryption and multi-factor authentication.
- **Availability**: 24/7 system access for users.

## Architecture Design

The system employs a modular architecture with four core components:

- **Reception Module**: Manages patient check-ins, appointments, and notifications.
- **Billing Module**: Handles invoicing, payment processing, and financial reporting.
- **Pharmacy Module**: Manages prescriptions, inventory, and medication alerts.
- **Patient Interaction Module**: Allows patients to view records, appointments, and communicate with staff.

### Architecture Diagram:
- **Presentation Layer**: Web-based interface for users.
- **Business Logic Layer**: PHP for server-side processing.
- **Data Layer**: MySQL database for data storage.

## Models

### 1. Activity Diagram

The activity diagram shows the flow of tasks in four central modules:

- **Reception**: Patient check-in, scheduling.
- **Billing**: Invoice generation, payment processing.
- **Pharmacy**: Prescription management and stock tracking.
- **Patient Interaction**: Patient data access and communication.

### 2. Use Case Diagram

Illustrates how various roles interact with the system, including receptionists, staff, pharmacists, and patients.

### 3. Sequence Diagrams

Outlines processes such as patient check-in, prescription processing, and billing.

### 4. Interface Designs

- **Reception Interface**: For patient check-in and appointment scheduling.
- **Pharmacy Interface**: For managing prescriptions and medications.
- **Billing Interface**: For invoice generation and payment processing.

## Conclusion

The Electronic Health Record (EHR) Management System streamlines hospital operations and enhances the quality of patient care. By integrating Reception, Billing, Pharmacy, and Patient Interaction modules, it provides a holistic solution for healthcare institutions. The system ensures the security of sensitive patient data and compliance with healthcare regulations.
